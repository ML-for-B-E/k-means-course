# What you will learn

this course will provide a short introdution to kmeans algorithm. The course consists of:

* one general lecture
* one practical work for beginner
* one pratical work for advanced

## objectives

### General lecture (2 hours)

* Give a definition of the kmeans algorithm and concrete example where it can be used
* Compute the dispersion of a scatter plot
* Describe the implementation step of the algorithm

### Practical work beginner (2 hours)

* Use sklearn to implement kmeans on a simulated dataset (definition, calibration and prediction)
* Get an intuition on how to choose the number of clusters

### Practical work advanced (2 hours)

* Derive the relationship between Total variance, inter variance and intra variance
* Use sklearn to implement kmeans on a simulated dataset (definition, calibration and prediction)
* know how to choose the number of clusters
* Implement the algorithm on a proper dataset
